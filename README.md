Developed a multi-agent system using the 

AutoGen framework and the Llama 3 (70B) Large Language Model to automate and streamline the academic literature review process. The system's design includes a 
Literature Review Writer Agent that drafts the review and an Editor Agent that provides feedback for improvements. Agents work collaboratively to fetch, 
summarize, and compile research papers. The system incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, allowing a user to provide additional feedback to the agents,
ensuring a balance between automation and human oversight. To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated content, the ROUGE score is used to compare the output
to human-written references. Key tools integrated into the system include the Google Scholar API for fetching articles and Regex for obtaining the final output.
The project focused on building agents, implementing their communication, and testing the system to ensure accurate and properly formatted literature reviews.
